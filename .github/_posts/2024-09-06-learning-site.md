[Launchcode](https://education.launchcode.org/) is a *free* developer learning resource which offers tutorials of decent quality and practical subject matter. In particular I can recommend the Java Web Developer course for its great first section! As it branches off into the Spring Boot area it gets a bit overly prescriptive with less in depth coverage of real "how" and "why" material and more tutorial voodoo (mutter this spell, and your web page will build itself), but for those who learn best by being shown something (rather than reading about it) this can also be a good thing.
